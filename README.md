## Preview

There is a demonstration of the footer, and how it can be customised, in the `/demo` directory.

    gem install jekyll
    jekyll serve

## How to implement the footer in your site

Youâ€™ll find most of the documentation in `_sass/style.scss`.

You can copy the markup and styles from `_includes/footer.html` and `_sass/_footer.scss` respectively.
